**NOTE** :
In order to run this github repo in your android studio just create a file named **local.properties** under Gradle Scripts with location of your Android SDK 
with the following line:

sdk.dir=/Users/YOURUSERNAME/Library/Android/sdk

MAPS_API_KEY=AI.... (this is your maps api key) the placeholder is the manifest (don't need to change that) so hopefully just putting the api here should work.

You will also need to set the run configurations to the defaults in the button next to the virtual device button
